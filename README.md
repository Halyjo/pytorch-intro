# PyTorch-intro
This repository contains a jupyter notebook with an introduction to PyTorch assuming you have previously worked with Numpy.

## Have a look
If you just want to see the code, go to `src/pytorch-intro.ipynb` and have a look at the notebook.


## Installation
### 1. Clone repository from where you want to work:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Halyjo/pytorch-intro.git 
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
Using `uv`:
```bash
cd pytorch-intro
uv sync
```

Using `pip`:
```bash
cd pytorch-intro
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Using other package managers:

If you are using a different setup, I recommend starting from a clean environment and installing the packages found in the **dependencies** list in `pyproject.toml` manually.

## Usage
1. Start jupyter notebook. Eg. by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook

2. Go to `src` and open `pytorch-intro.ipynb` notebook.

3. Play around and learn!
